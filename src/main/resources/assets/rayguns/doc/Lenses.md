Lenses are an optional extra that can be added to a raygun to change its
behavior in some way.

## Precise Lens

This finely-ground lens will focus your shots better than having no lens at all
increasing your maximum range substantially at the cost of a 50% power cost
penalty.

## Wide Lens

This rough-cut lens will split the beam or bolt into a spray of shots that, 
while individually less powerful, cover a much greater area and greater total
damage. However, it will triple the power cost of each shot.
