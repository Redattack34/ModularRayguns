Batteries provide the power for your rayguns. They can be charged with RF energy
in any block that accepts flux capacitors. By default, one energy unit is equal
to 20 RF, but this can be adjusted using the config files. The charge rates
provided assume that the energy source is capable of producing enough energy - 
your mileage may vary.
