Accessories are an optional upgrade that you can attach to your gun for a wide
variety of effects.

## Charge Capacitor

The Charge Capacitor allows you to charge your shots before firing them. The
damage and power cost of a charged shot is proportional to the time spent
charging it, up to a maximum of three seconds. Different beam chambers will also
have different effects depending on how charged they are when fired. For example,
the Frost Ray will freeze a larger volume of water when fully charged. However,
the need to charge your shots before firing will reduce your fire rate, so make
your shots count.

## High-Efficiency Wiring

By using more energy-efficient wiring in your gun, you can reduce the power cost
of any shot by one third.

## Refire Capacitor

Adding a second firing capacitor to your gun allows you to fire again in half
the time.

## Solar Panel

Attaching a solar panel to your gun will allow it to recharge slowly when
outside during the day.
