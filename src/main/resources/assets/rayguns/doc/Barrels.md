The Barrel of a raygun determines the shape of the resulting shot. A barrel is
required to make a working raygun.

## Blaster Barrel

Shots fired through a Blaster Barrel produce energy bolts - projectiles which, 
although they move quite quickly, can be dodged. There is no power cost penalty
for using a Blaster Barrel.

## Beam Barrel

The Beam Barrel channels the raw energy of your gun into a lightning-fast beam
that connects with the target instantaneously. The beams produced can also be
quite spectacular. Beam shots take %20 more energy than bolt shots.
