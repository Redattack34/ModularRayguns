Assembling a raygun is quite a simple task. You will need to construct a
Raygun Workbench and a Lens Grinder first (see NEI for details). Then you'll
need the parts you intend to assemble into your raygun.

First, you'll need a frame to hold all of the parts together. The frames are
purely cosmetic, so pick any one you like. Then, assemble a
[Laser Beam Chamber](rayguns:doc/BeamChambers.md), a 
[Basic Battery](rayguns:doc/Batteries.md), and a 
[Blaster Barrel](rayguns:doc/Barrels.md). Place the parts into the appropriate
slots in the Raygun Workbench and withdraw your completed gun. You can also
disassemble a raygun by placing it in the raygun slot of an empty workbench.

You can further improve your new raygun by replacing any of the parts you've
added or by adding a lens or other accessory. See the appropriate pages for more
details.
